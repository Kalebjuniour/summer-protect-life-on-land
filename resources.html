                <p> Two billion hectares of land on Earth are degraded, affecting some 3.2 billion people, driving species to extinction and intensifying climate change. Goal 15: Life on land Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life provides 80 percent of the human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resources. Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth’s surface, provide vital habitats for millions of species, and important sources for clean air and water, as well as being crucial for combating climate change.</p>

                <p>Forests cover nearly 31 per cent of our planet’s land area. From the air we breathe, to the water we drink, to the food we eat.
                    -Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood.
                    -Forests are home to more than 80 percent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. Of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction.

                <p>At the current time, thirteen million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares. Even though up to 15% of land is currently under protection, biodiversity is still at risk. Deforestation and desertification – caused by human activities and climate change – pose major challenges to sustainable development and have affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the fight against poverty.
